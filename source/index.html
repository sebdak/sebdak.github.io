<h1>Hi, I'm Sebastian</h1>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer, graphic designer and hardware enthusiast specializing
  in full stack web development. I appreciate the esthetically pleasing aspect
  of a well designed and functional product, and use engineering to put it into
  action. Seeing something go from an idea to finished product gives me
  motivation.
